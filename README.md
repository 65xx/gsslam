gsslam [binfile] [ramfile]

This is a tiny utility whose sole purpose is to write a 65c816 binary generated by 64TASS (as a nonlinear format file) into the RAM of a GSplus Apple 2GS emulator, tweaked to expose its RAM as a file ( https://github.com/stacksmith/gsplus ).

This simplifies my development process: I can assemble an application and store it directly into the emulator, and test it there.

The nonlinear format is simple.  A nonlinear file consists of binary segments; each starts with a 3-byte size, 3-byte address, and binary data.   If the size is 0 we are at the end.

To generate such a file, use the -X parameter to force a 3-byte size/address, and -n for nonlinear.
